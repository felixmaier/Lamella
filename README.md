Beautiful Visual Programming inside the Web.

Project itself is in a unfinished state.

It's pretty easy to add new models to the engine, checkout *./app/res/models/* to see how it's done.

The programming logic isn't much implemented yet.<br/>
If you want to test it, wire two DataType entities (numeric for example) with a operator entity.<br/>
Make sure the operator entity's output anchor (the bottom one) is connected with another entity.<br/>
Click on the *Play* button and open your console.
